        "\n",
        "Ans:  The backslash \"\\\" is a special character, also called the \"escape\" character. It is used in representing certain whitespace characters: \"\\t\" is a tab, \"\\n\" is a newline, and \"\\r\" is a carriage return. Conversely, prefixing a special character with \"\\\" turns it into an ordinary character.\n",

        "\n",
        "Ans: The string \"Howl's Moving Castle\" escaped the problem because it is inside double quotes. If this had been wrapped in single quotes then we had to use escape character \\' to show in single quote. \n",
